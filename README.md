# FilterShoppe
A one stop lomography shop that aims to have you putting up affable [SannaKvist](https://sannahkvist.se/) and [AlisonScarpula](https://www.flickr.com/photos/aliscarpulla/) tributes in no time!

This project is instantly accessible as a [Pen](https://codepen.io/ksabalo/pen/JjYNpOm) on [CodePen](https://codepen.io/ksabalo).

You can use this application to locally manipulate images from your personal collection. The app has support for filters and a number of blending methods, including Green Screen. There is also the option to create your own filters and blends (in JavaScript) by selecting the 'Custom' option. 
There is also rudimentary undo/redo support via the 'Revert/Cache' buttons. It's not automatic but if used wisely it can be a mood saver.
